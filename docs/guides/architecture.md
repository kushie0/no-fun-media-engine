# Architecture

## Mixin inheritance

```
Pipeline(VideoMixin, AudioMixin, CleanupMixin,
        InventoryMenuMixin, StreamsMenuMixin,
        JobsMenuMixin, ReprocessMenuMixin)
    │
    ├── VideoMixin          (nofun/video.py)           — quadrant encode, clip export, rename
    ├── AudioMixin          (nofun/audio.py)           — channel split, ZIP archive
    ├── CleanupMixin        (nofun/cleanup.py)         — audit findings, delete queue management
    ├── InventoryMenuMixin  (nofun/menu_inventory.py)  — INVENTORY/STATUS menu commands (SCAN, RENAME, REMASTER, etc.)
    ├── StreamsMenuMixin    (nofun/menu_streams.py)    — STREAMS menu commands
    ├── JobsMenuMixin       (nofun/menu_jobs.py)       — JOBS menu commands (CANCEL, etc.)
    └── ReprocessMenuMixin  (nofun/menu_reprocess.py)  — REPROCESS menu commands
```

`Pipeline.__init__` sets shared attributes (`search_dir`, `mount_d`, `enc`, `trial_run`,
`force`, etc.) that all the mixins read via `self`. The mixins have no `__init__` and
do not call `super().__init__`.

## Data flow

      (single multi-ch file)    └── pan filters → YYYYMMDD_Band_ch01.wav … → ZIP
```

## PAUSE state machine

```
RUNNING ──PAUSE──► SOFT_PENDING ──PAUSE (mid-encode)──► HARD_PENDING ──► PAUSED
                                                                              │
RUNNING ◄──RESUME──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **SOFT_PENDING**: current ffmpeg job finishes, then the watchdog loop stops.
- **HARD_PENDING**: `_current_ffmpeg_proc.kill()` is called; partial output is moved
  to `mount_d/hard_paused/`. The PAUSED transition happens at the end of the watchdog
  loop iteration (not in `_handle_command`).
- **PAUSED**: watchdog loop is idle, waiting for RESUME.

## Threading model

```
Main thread                       Worker thread (Textual worker)
─────────────────────────         ─────────────────────────────────────
MediaEngineApp.run()              Pipeline.run_with_queue(cmd_queue, app)
  └── Textual event loop            └── watchdog loop
        │                                  ├── _detect_file_events()
        │  cmd_queue.put(cmd)              ├── _process_mov() / _export_audio_zips()
        │◄─────────────── keyboard ─────   └── cmd_queue.get_nowait()
        │
        │  app.update_status(markup)
        │◄──── call_from_thread() ─────────┘
        │
        └── Widget.refresh()
```

`run_ffmpeg` accepts `progress_cb` and `proc_cb` callbacks so the worker thread can
push frame progress to the TUI and store the `Popen` handle for mid-encode kill.

## SharePoint / OneDrive lifecycle

Files are shared with bands via a OneDrive folder (`OneDrive - No Fun Troy LLC/Multitracks/`).
Each performance gets a date subfolder (`YY-MM-DD_BAND1_BAND2/`) containing quad MP4s, the
audio ZIP, and a `_nofun_info.txt` manifest listing files and expiry date.

```
Multitracks/
  26-05-20_DEARMARYANNE_ETLY/   ← active: media present, within 28-day window
  26-03-15_PV/                  ← active: media present, expires ~Jun 6
  archived/
    26-04-30_GRATITUDE/         ← expired stub: only _nofun_info.txt remains
    26-04-29_NODIVISION/        ← expired stub
    …
  _sharepoint_permissions_YYYY-MM-DD.csv   ← access report (not for bands)
```

**Lifecycle stages:**

1. **SYNC** (`_sync_eligible_performances`, every 15 min) — copies quad MP4s and audio ZIP
   into the date folder; writes `_nofun_info.txt` with file list and 28-day expiry.
2. **EXPIRE** (`_auto_expire_cloud_shares`, hourly) — deletes media files once past expiry;
   updates `_nofun_info.txt` with a "files removed" note so bands who navigate there see an
   explanation rather than an empty folder.
3. **ARCHIVE** (`_archive_empty_cloud_folders`, called at the end of each expire run) — moves
   the now-stub folder into `archived/`. The move is a filesystem `rename()`, which OneDrive
   treats as a MOVE (item ID preserved), so any shared link given to bands still resolves to
   the folder even in its new location.
4. **RE-UPLOAD** (`_reupload_performance`, INVENTORY → REUPLOAD command) — if a band needs
   files after expiry, moves the folder back from `archived/` to the top level and re-syncs,
   resetting the 28-day clock.

**Key invariants:**
- The engine never deletes or recreates date folders — only `rename()` moves and file-level
  `unlink()` deletes. SharePoint item IDs (and therefore shared links) are always preserved.
- `archived/` is skipped by inventory scans and expiry checks — files there are considered
  permanently expired and will not be re-deleted or re-synced automatically.
- The `_nofun_info.txt` system file is never deleted, only rewritten. It is excluded from
  "has media" checks so a folder containing only an info stub is treated as empty.

## Delete queue

`DeleteQueue` accumulates files with `.add(path, reason)`. `execute()` is called
automatically each pipeline loop iteration and deletes all queued files without
requiring any confirmation command.

## StreamServer / StreamWorker

```
StreamServer
  └── [StreamWorker × N]
        ├── ffmpeg (subprocess) → HLS segments → BytesIO broadcast
        └── _ThreadingHTTPServer
              └── HTTP clients subscribe via queue.Queue
```

Each `StreamWorker` runs an ffmpeg subprocess that re-encodes clips into an HLS stream
and broadcasts chunks to all connected HTTP clients. Slow clients have chunks dropped
(not disconnected) to avoid blocking faster clients.
